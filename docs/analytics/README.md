# Analytics

Firebase Analytics (GA4), on Android, iOS, macOS and the web, one Firebase project for all of them, the one
Crashlytics and Android's push notifications use ([crash-reporting.md](../crash-reporting.md)). Each platform sends
through its own official SDK; the shared code decides what is tracked, so the same action sends the same event on
every UI.

## How it fits

| Piece | Where | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TrackEvent` | `:core:provider:analytics` | How the shared code tracks an event: a name and its params. A Boolean goes as `"true"` or `"false"` (GA4 has no boolean), a whole number as a Long, any other as a Double, an enum as its name in lowercase; any other value is left out, never sent as its text |
| `AnalyticsHub` | `:core:provider:analytics` | Where the events go: once an app attaches its platform's `AnalyticsService`. The first 50 before that wait for it, so the opening screen counts on the web too, which attaches only once the page drew |
| `FirebaseAnalyticsService` | `:core:provider:analytics`'s `androidMain` | Android's, attached by `BlitzSplitApplication` |
| `FirebaseSetup.swift` | `iosApp/Sources/Shared/App` | Apple's, attached through `BlitzSplitApple.attachAnalytics` once the shared code started |
| `firebaseAnalytics.ts` | `webApp/src/analytics` | The web's, through `firebase/analytics`, attached through the exported `attachAnalytics` |

No event is tracked yet: each user action's event comes with its feature, through `TrackEvent`.

## What is never sent

- **A name, an amount or an id** (a group's, a bill's, a person's), in an event's params or anywhere else: the event
  goes to Google. Params say what kind of thing happened (`split_mode`, `source`, `is_new`), never whose or how much.
- **Anything from a debug build**: Android's manifest turns collection off for the debug build type
  (`analyticsCollectionEnabled`), Apple's Info.plist for the Debug configuration (`ANALYTICS_COLLECTION_ENABLED`), and
  `FirebaseSetup` sets it again on every launch, since the setting persists on the device; a debug build never attaches
  either, and the web only starts in a production build.
- **The advertising id**: Android removes the `AD_ID` permission and turns its collection off, Apple links
  `FirebaseAnalytics` without `FirebaseAnalyticsIdentitySupport`, and the web turns Google signals off. Ad
  personalization is off on all of them.
- **A screen view the SDK makes up**: Android's and Apple's automatic screen reporting are off and gtag sends no
  `page_view`, since the activity, the view controllers and the browser's history don't name the app's screens.
  Screen views are to come from the shared back stack, the same on every UI; until that is tracked, no build sends
  any.

## Consent

Release builds collect from the first launch, with no prompt nor opt-out yet: whether the app asks first or offers a
toggle in Perfil is Pierre's call, still open, and the Play Data safety form and the App Store privacy labels need
updating before a release that collects.

## What stays off until it is set up

Every build runs without it, CI's included.

- **Android, iOS and macOS** read the same config files as Crashlytics: `androidApp/google-services.json` and
  `iosApp/Resources/GoogleService-Info.plist` ([crash-reporting.md](../crash-reporting.md#what-stays-off-until-it-is-set-up)).
  Turn Google Analytics on for the Firebase project first, so the files carry its ids.
- **The web**: a web app in the same Firebase project, whose config the production build reads from the environment
  (`webApp/.env.production.local`, git-ignored, or the host's build settings):

  ```properties
  VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<apiKey>
  VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<appId>
  VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<projectId>
  VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=<measurementId>
  ```

  In Google Analytics, turn off the web stream's enhanced measurement of "page changes based on browser history
  events", which would add a `page_view` per route on top of the shared code's screen views.

## Check it

Release builds only. Android: `adb shell setprop debug.firebase.analytics.app com.quare.blitzsplit`, then open the
app and see the events in Firebase's DebugView. Apple: run the release scheme with `-FIRDebugEnabled` among the
launch arguments. Web: the Google Analytics Debugger extension, or DebugView with `?debug_mode=true`.
